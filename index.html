Introduction
Welcome to VaultRoam ("we", "our", or "us"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it.

Information We Collect
We collect information that you voluntarily provide when using the app, including:

Account Information: Your name and authentication credentials when you create an account.
Trip Data: Trip details, itineraries, events, expenses, and checklists you create within the app.
Photos & Media: Photos you add to trips and photo storybooks. These are stored locally on your device.
Documents: Passport scans, travel documents, and other files you store in the Secure Vault. These remain on your device and are protected by biometric authentication.

AI-Powered Features
Our app uses Google's Gemini AI to provide features such as AI-generated travel narratives and photo storybooks. When you use these features:

Your photos and trip details may be sent to Google's Gemini API for processing.
We do not store or retain any data sent to or received from the AI service beyond your current session.
Use of AI features is optional and initiated only by your explicit action.
Camera & Photo Library
The app requests access to your camera and photo library to allow you to:

Capture photos of travel documents for the Secure Vault.
Add photos to your trips and storybooks.
Camera and photo library access is only used when you explicitly initiate these actions. We do not access your camera or photos in the background.
Data Storage & Security

All your trip data, photos, and documents are stored locally on your device.
Secure Vault documents are protected by your device's biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID).
We do not upload your personal data to external servers unless you explicitly use a feature that requires it (e.g., AI narration).
Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. Your data may only be shared when:

You explicitly choose to share trip details via email or messaging.
You use AI-powered features that require sending data to Google's Gemini API for processing.

You have the right to:

Access all data stored within the app at any time.
Delete your account and all associated data through the app settings.
Opt out of AI-powered features at any time.
